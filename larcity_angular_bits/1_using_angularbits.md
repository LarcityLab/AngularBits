<h1>Using {{ site.vars.shortname }} <span class="label label-warning">Incomplete</span></h1>

Your first step is to get familiar with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) if you are not already. As we mentioned earlier, this is a framework for developing slick user interfaces. 

{{ site.vars.shortname }} extends the awesome tools this framework delivers to a UI developer, and the work we've done shows how you can speed up your prototyping process by using these (or similar) filters / controllers / services across your applications. 

If you're already familiar with AngularJS - great. Take a look at the `/src/` directory of this repository to check out the shell of a sample application that utilizes all of the libraries included here.
